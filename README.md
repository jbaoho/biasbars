# biasbars

This repository is a project from Stanford's CS106A course. The aim of the assignment is to use tkinter to visualize bias when using different words to describe men and women. The program reads in data from a set of words and their frequencies for men and women and then runs a GUI to display the data for any particular word that is searched. The data is displayed using a bar chart style graph of frequency of cases of men versus women being described by the specific word. The repository contains python files for the implmentation of the GUI and data analysis.
